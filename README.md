# awesome-llm-reasoning
Collections of resources for LLM reasoning, including papers, codes and data. 
There are numbers of awesome repos focus on reasoning of LLM, we try to summarize these methods in a different angle, their specific domain,
such common reasoning, math, table related, KG relate or multimodal(welcome to name them more).

*Papers here may not be well evaluated by now for the sake of time, any suggestion are well appreciated!*
